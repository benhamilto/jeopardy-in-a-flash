# jeopardy-in-a-flash
A frontend to fetch and display Jeopardy! questions from jService (https://github.com/sottenad/jService)

Sorry, due to CORS settings in the JService API this no longer works. I previously was using a CORS proxy but it seems it has been shut down. I may or may not get to 
putting up my own (no promises).
